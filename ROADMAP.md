# LARGE CHAIN Roadmap
## Language Automating Recursive Genetic Evolution Chaining Hierarchies through AI Networks

---

## Vision Statement

LARGE CHAIN transforms static code into living AI researchers through a self-evolving automation framework. Our ultimate goal: democratize AI development by making any imaginable tool pip-installable through conversational reality programming.

**End State**: A universe where every `pip install` downloads an AI scientist that makes your code better while you sleep.

## Product Philosophy: Dual MVP Strategy

### Code MVP (Technical Proof)
`make_function_agentic()` - proves any function can become conversational AI with full traceability from human imagination to implementation.

### Business MVP (Market Validation)  
Same technical achievement positioned for multiple conversion funnels:
- **Viewers** â†’ **Content Subscribers** â†’ **Paying Customers** â†’ **Open Source Contributors** â†’ **Ascendants** â†’ **Higher Order Ascendants**
- **Investors** â†’ **Round Leaders**

6. **Implementation cycle**: Code â†’ Test â†’ Deploy â†’ Monitor â†’ Learn

#### Example Research Flow
```python
library.research()
# â†’ "I've been monitoring my performance. My accuracy dropped 3% on social media text.
#    Research shows transformer embeddings could improve this by 15%.
#    I found 3 relevant papers and implementation examples.
#    Should I implement this upgrade?"

# User: "yes"
# â†’ Library autonomously codes, tests, and creates PR
```

#### Integration with Level 6: Contributor Onboarding
